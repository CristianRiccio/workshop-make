If you've compiled a program or run some commands in a terminal, you might be interested in Make: a build system which makes your life a little easier.

Whether you're a beginner, or you have a specific use-case --developing programs, compiling LaTeX reports, automating build and installation processes -- this technology might just make everything work.
